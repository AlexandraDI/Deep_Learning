* [Task 1](https://github.com/AlexandraDI/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Project_1/DL_Assignment1.ipynb){:target="_blank"}:
The goal of this task is to produce a neural network model that is best suited for training a given dataset. This dataset consists of a 1000-by-1 vector of 8-bit unsigned integers. The values of the vector are shown below.

</p>

Furthermore, we trained our model to predict a data point one step ahead for a fracture of the data. To solve this issue, we implemented two different architectures to train our data. In the [project report](https://github.com/AlexandraDI/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Project_1/DL_Assignment_1.pdf){:target="_blank"}, we explain why we chose these two architectures and present the results. Some of the results are shown below.

Prediction of the next 200 points:

* [Task 2](https://github.com/AlexandraDI/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Project_2/DL_Assignment_2.ipynb){:target="_blank"}:
The goal of this task is to produce a neural network model in a recursive fashion to predict the temperature of a city given previous meteorological
measurements. In addition, to find a strategy to determine which features are the more relevant for the results, and to use visualisation techniques to show
them. This dataset consists of a 70128 by 4 by 5 vector that contains the information of the time, the location and the meteorological features respectively. The temperatures of the four locations are shown below.
