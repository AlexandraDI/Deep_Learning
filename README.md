# Deep_Learning

The goal of this project is to produce a neural network model that is best
suited for training a given dataset. This dataset consists of a 1000-by-1 vector
of 8-bit unsigned integers. The values of the vector are shown below.


Furthermore, we must train our model to predict a data point one step ahead
for a fracture of the data. To solve this issue, we implemented two different
architectures to train our data. In the project report [hyperlink], we explain why
we chose these two architectures and present the results.
