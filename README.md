# Deep Learning


## Project 1
The goal of this project is to produce a neural network model that is best suited for training a given dataset. This dataset consists of a 1000-by-1 vector of 8-bit unsigned integers. The values of the vector are shown below.

Furthermore, we trained our model to predict a data point one step ahead for a fracture of the data. To solve this issue, we implemented two different architectures to train our data. In the [project report](https://github.com/AlexandraDI/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Project_1/DL_Assignment_1.pdf){:target="_blank"}, we explain why we chose these two architectures and present the results.

Prediction of the next 200 points:
